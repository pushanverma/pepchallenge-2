DEAR VIEWER , 


I have implemented the browser automation part in intro.js , you can check the code , scrapping part is involved in request.js (because of time constraints) i was unable to able
to scrapping partially , but i can say that i have completed the automation part successfully it was amazing to learn at very fast pace. You can view the video also , where i have demonstrated the project that i made.
